Using the provided API, I have created a web page to find the required phone based on brand names.
I've used HTML, Tailwind CSS and Javascript to create the web page.

Post creating the required page using HTML to make sure that the UI is clean, we have used multiple Javascript concepts such as Async & await functionality, getElementById, remove and add classlist and many more to provide the required functionality.

When the page loads, you can see the main navbar and the required text below it with images.
Below them a search bar is present, and below that, we will have few phone cards by default which have the id 13 in them. If you click on the serach box and input any brand name, you'll get the list of phones of that particular brand. And on clicking on Show Details,
be able to see all the extra details as per the mentioned requirement.
If you want to see the whole list of a particular brand, just click on Show All, and you will get your results.
